# Agents Overview

Pancaik provides a flexible agent-based architecture that allows you to create, configure, and run automated agents for various tasks.

## Available Agents

- **[TwitterAgent](twitter_agent.md)**: For interacting with Twitter, monitoring accounts, and indexing tweets.

## Common Agent Configuration

Agents in Pancaik are configured using YAML files that define:

1. Agent identity and metadata
2. Service-specific credentials and settings
3. Tasks the agent should perform
4. Scheduling details for those tasks

Each agent type has its own specific configuration options, which are documented in their respective pages.
